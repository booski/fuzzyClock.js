# fuzzyClock.js

A fuzzy clock presenting the time and date in the format a human would 
probably choose if answering the question "What time is it?".

Will report the time up to 5 minutes ahead, but never be behind.

Currently Swedish only, how to internationalize without just reimplementing 
the algorithm is an open question.
